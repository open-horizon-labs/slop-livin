# Changelog

Release notes describe behavior at the named version. See the [README](README.md) and [usage reference](docs/usage.md) for current behavior. Timings below are historical observations from one developer's machine, not a benchmark suite.

## v0.5.2

- Narrowed Ruby dependency attribution to `vendor/bundle`, preserving unrelated vendored source.
- Added declarative project-name fallbacks for Gradle settings, Cabal, and Python `setup.cfg` manifests.
- Made strict JSON manifest names structural and top-level only.
- Added regressions for shared Rust workspace targets and independent nested project targets.

## v0.5.1

- Fixed project badges with linked worktree counts so the worktree glyph and multi-digit count remain visually separated in the terminal UI.

## v0.5.0

- Fixed persistence of existing artifact byte changes in `current.parquet`. Added regression coverage for successive updates and unchanged observations after an update.
- Renamed the repository, source packages, binaries, environment variables, and release artifacts to `swamp`. The v0.5.0 archive contains `swamp` and `swamp-mcp`.
- Reorganized the documentation into a product overview, usage reference, architecture guide, and contributor guide. Corrected outdated UI, filter, installation, and history claims.

## v0.4.0

### Docker removal

- Added image and volume removal to the CLI, MCP, and TUI through Docker. This includes objects without project attribution.
- Added object-specific recovery information to plans, confirmations, and ledger records. Filesystem paths go to Trash; Docker removals do not. Images may be pulled or rebuilt if their sources remain available; swamp makes no copy of volume contents.
- Refused individual build-cache removal because the action path does not support that unit.
- Added live object checks before removal and surfaced Docker's refusal text.
- Separated trashed bytes, permanent removals, and measured free-space change in results.
- Added a Docker fixture with attributed and unattributed images, a volume, dangling images, build cache, and a container that prevents image removal.

### Git tracking and actions

- Split the worktree remainder into tracked `source`, `ignored`, and `untracked` buckets using directory-level Git status with large-file corrections. Apportioned totals preserve the walk's measured bytes.
- Prevented deletion of the ignored/untracked aggregate buckets as single paths.
- Reused the Git exclude stack within a checkout.
- Allowed direct project actions to select its actionable artifacts. When none exist, a direct action can offer the checkout; bulk marking skips that fallback.

### Terminal UI

- Replaced row sparklines with logarithmic change bars: growth extends right in red, shrink left in green, and changes below 1 MB use a small tick.
- Sorted growth by signed value, so increases precede decreases.
- Made Right open/expand and Left collapse/return, matching the displayed navigation.
- Fixed negative growth formatting, duplicated carried-forward GitHub signals, and empty container names.

### Storage and checks

- Changed report-history Parquet writes to close a temporary file before renaming it over the destination. This protects readers from unfinished individual files; it is not a multi-file transaction.
- Corrected source checks that matched their own explanatory comments and removed their ripgrep dependency.
- Corrected the fixture's dangling-image case on Docker installations using the containerd image store.

## v0.3.0

### Live and incremental observation

- Added a live FSEvents watch while the TUI is open, with observation after 400 ms of quiet.
- Retained directory detail inside folded artifacts so updates can re-list changed interior directories.
- Added a whole-artifact fallback for hardlinked units and local byte measurements to support deduplicated incremental accounting.
- Re-listed known remainder directories without walking their entire worktree when possible.
- Built one history index per growth-annotation pass and skipped unchanged current-file writes.
- Reused and aged Git signals for untouched worktrees, cached Docker facts for five minutes, and limited discovery around changed directories.

The release recorded these observations on one `~/src` tree with 55 projects and about 44 GB. Hardware details, repeated samples, and a reproducible benchmark harness were not supplied with the table.

| Case | v0.2.0 | v0.3.0 |
|---|---|---|
| Source file touched | 7.5 s | 75 ms |
| Change inside a 16 GB `target/` | 7.5 s | 2.4 s |
| No change | 7.5 s | 86 ms |

### Artifact recognition

- Added recognition of regular `CACHEDIR.TAG` files with the required signature.
- Vendored ignore/language lists and added a harvest utility to report candidate artifact names without editing the classification table.
- Expanded marker-gated recognition across ecosystems, including ESP-IDF, Godot, Jekyll, Elm, Erlang, OCaml, Clojure, and Nim.
- Added ESP-IDF `managed_components/` and build variants, CMake build variants, and Python `requirements*` markers.

### UI and reporting

- Changed growth to red and shrink to green; used a dark selection background to preserve those colors.
- Added history charts based on observed changes and ecosystem badges after project names.
- Preserved selection during background refresh.
- Included directory rows in the startup observation.
- Corrected progress counters and limited percentage display to cases where the previous total is a usable estimate.
- Added `--version` and release-version smoke checks.

## v0.2.0

- Added project ecosystem detection, marker-gated artifact classification, type filters and sorting, a types view, and manifest-based names for repositories without remotes.
- Added size and age predicates, project globs, more sorts, and persisted UI choices.
- Added the keep-executables option for supported Rust and Python outputs.
- Added observation progress and UI refresh after removal.
- Forced a full walk after classification-rule changes.
- Added time-series display with unobserved buckets represented separately from zero changes.
- Reorganized report construction into consumers on an in-memory event bus. See [ADR 001](docs/ADRs/001-event-bus-report-pipeline.md).
- Added source audits for selected implementation constraints and a mutation script for walker checks.
- Added configuration commands and MCP report filtering.

## v0.1.0

- Introduced a terminal UI, CLI, and stdio MCP server for disk growth by project, checkout/worktree, and artifact.
- Added Parquet history with reverse deltas, FSEvents-based incremental observation, and optional scheduled observation.
- Grouped clones by remote and exposed worktree activity, Git tracking, and cached GitHub facts.
- Added Docker attribution by Compose/source evidence, with unmatched objects reported as unowned. Docker removal arrived in v0.4.0.
- Added filesystem reconciliation and an optional `du` comparison.
- Added action plans, CLI approval and standing grants, execution, and ledger records.

The initial release targeted Apple silicon macOS with unsigned binaries. History began with the first observation. Performance figures were observations from one machine.
